# NerdBot For DISCORD_TOKEN
## Written By Dominic Dayta

All commands begin with !nerd followed by the command, and your arguments. Note that extraneous arguments will be ignored by the nerd!

### Commands

`nerd`

Summons the nerd. This is an error wherein the nerdbot does get any command despite having been summoned. The nerdbot can get salty when this is done too many times so try to avoid!
